Client library to use GraphSchema.io from C# as an object store.

See it's use for example in the Dgraph-dotnet E2e tests project.

There's not going to be much in th way of testing in here - that's all done in the GraphSchema.io pipeline to ensure the client works with latest GraphSchema.io version.  

This is early stages, but I'll try hard not to make breaking changes so as to not break existing automation.
